# LinkedIn Profile Finder Automation

This project automatically finds **real LinkedIn profile links** using simple input from Google Sheets.

Instead of manually searching LinkedIn or Google, you just enter a job role and location (for example:  
`machine learning engineer india`) in a Google Sheet, and the system does the rest.

## How It Works

1. You add a job role and location in a Google Sheet  
2. The automation reads the input  
3. An AI model converts it into a Google search query  
4. The search is restricted to **only LinkedIn personal profiles**  
5. Matching LinkedIn profile links are collected  
6. Results are saved back into a Google Sheet automatically  

No chat input or manual searching is needed.
